        Elasticsearch and Redis. TUI Musement’s backend architecture embraces  the

        <p><strong>Green-Energy Lead Backend Developer - saving the planet!</strong><br
        /><strong>Location: Edinburgh / hybrid remote.</strong><strong><br /><strong>Salary:
        &#163;55,000 &#43; equity, negotiable ~&#163;20K, package around &#163;75K&#43;<br
        /><br /></strong></strong></p> <p>Transitioning our energy grid is one of
        the best things developed countries can do to lower carbon emissions.</p>
        <p>But what about all of those countries who don’t have big, centralised grid
        networks supplying energy to every building and citizen?</p> <p>How do we
        cut the use of 100 million diesel generators in Nigeria? Or enable rural Indian
        or Congolese people to stop burning charcoal and wood for heating their food?</p>
        <p>These communities are suffering the direct impacts of extreme climate events
        already, they know they need to decarbonise, but don’t always have the resources
        and political backing to do so, especially not at the scale needed.</p> <p>The
        solution isn’t one company becoming big enough to solve all of these problems.
        The solution is enabling and empowering lots of companies to drive the transition
        from within communities.</p> <p>Giving people on the ground the tools, platforms
        and frameworks - which are proven and adaptable - to create clean and reliable
        energy for their communities. Sustainable and simple as the source of energy
        is the world around us, rather than diesel generators  and carbon intensive
        fuels.</p> <p>Tech wise, Internet of Things and Python are the holy grail
        here. Their software uses remote sensors to deliver accurate data on energy
        use, among other things. Exposure to DevOps, CICD pipelines, provisioning,
        testing, automation and all those goodies will  stand out, but soft skills
        are important too.</p> <p>They mostly use Django and Python but have two junior
        - mid level devs and a senior who are deeply passionate and eager for guidance.
        They want to better understand architecture, be able to scale up services
        confidently and build resilient and robust software.  They need a good mentor.</p>
        <p>They’ll consider folks who’ve been using Java, PHP, Ruby, NodeJs or similar,
        so long as you’re happy to learn Python and Django on the job and support
        the growth of those around you, raising the skills and standards of the team.</p>
        <p>And of course, as with any role in this sector, you need to be able to
        demonstrate that you truly care about delivering solutions to our biggest
        problems, potentially THE biggest problem.</p> <p>We can’t afford to watch
        the developing world to take the same path the global North has taken. Fossil
        fuel dependency, carbon, extraction, plundering of global resources to sustain
        economies and create thriving communities.</p> <p>This company are helping
        communities build a renewable energy supply, in a sustainable way that can
        ease the pressures faced by those communities, building resilience by cutting
        the use of carbon intensive fuels.</p> <p>The team work in a hybrid remote
        style, so you’ll decide with them how to work best. And the company are offering
        equity, with a reasonable valuation and strong financial backing.</p> <p>If
        you see clean, green energy, as a key to a sustainable future and making a
        difference matters to you or you’d like to turn your skills to delivering
        real impact, please apply or reach out.</p> ","applicationCount":8}'
