        actively seeking an experienced Backend PHP Developer to join their team and
        contribute towards the continual success of their robust market leading innovative
        platform.<br /></p> <p>What will I be doing?</p> <ul> <li>Developing and implementing
        game-changing features for their platform<br /></li><li>Taking a leading role

        including EC2, ECS, Elasticache, S3 and Lambda all built and managed with
        CloudFormation and Terraform. However, they don''t expect you to know everything,

        <p>They work with agile methodologies and are always looking to increase test
        coverage across their applications, so having a good understanding of the
